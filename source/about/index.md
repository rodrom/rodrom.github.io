## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Rodrigo. Freelance **Fullstack Software Engineer** based on Berlin and born in Madrid, Spain, with more than 16 years of experience in web development and a wide range of IT, business, and almost any kind of related tasks with the day to day of any company.

## Who Needs My Expertise?

Are you a company or professional without deep expertise in Software or IT? Do you often feel a step behind the latest trends, overwhelmed by buzzwords like AI, cloud solutions, eCommerce, API integrations, cybersecurity, and more? I’m here to help you cut through the noise and focus on what truly matters for your business. My goal is to help you understand what you actually need versus what others may want you to think you need.

With extensive experience working with SMEs as an **Fullstack Software Engineer** and **IT Specialist**, I have a particular focus on the training sector —whether online, on-premises, or hybrid. I've also worked closely with professionals in Mental Health, e.g. EMDR— Additionally, my compentence extends to medium and large companies as a Fullstack Web Developer and PHP Backend Developer.

My philosophy is that while tools are important, understanding the problem is paramount. Only then can we choose the right tools. I can assist you in selecting the best technology stack that perfectly fits your needs.

I offer end-to-end solutions, custom-designed for your company, which can be easily updated or improved as your needs evolve.

If an existing solution already meets your needs, I can guide you in selecting the best service, helping with setup, and providing ongoing mentorship.

Alternatively, if you have everything ready—schedules, designs, and plans—and just need extra hands to meet your deadline, I can step in and help you complete the project on time.
